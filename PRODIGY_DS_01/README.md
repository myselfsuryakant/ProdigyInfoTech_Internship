# Task 01: Data Visualization - Population Age Distribution

## Project Description

This project, as part of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship, focuses on fundamental data visualization. The goal is to create a clear and informative bar chart visualizing the age distribution of a hypothetical population. This task demonstrates proficiency in using Python's `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries for data representation.

## Dataset

For this task, a hypothetical dataset representing age groups and their corresponding population counts was used. The data is directly embedded within the Python script for simplicity.

**Hypothetical Data:**
* **Age Groups:** 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71+
* **Population Counts:** (Corresponding counts for each age group)

## Libraries Used

* **`pandas`**: For data manipulation (though minimal for this simple dataset, it's good practice).
* **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
* **`seaborn`**: A high-level data visualization library based on matplotlib, providing a more aesthetically pleasing interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## Files

* `age_distribution_chart.py`: The Python script that generates the bar chart.
* `age_distribution_chart.png`: The output image file of the generated bar chart.

## How to Run the Script

1.  **Ensure you have Python installed.**
2.  **Install the necessary libraries** if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the `Task_01_DataVisualization` directory** in your terminal or command prompt:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/ProdigyInfoTech_Internship/Task_01_DataVisualization
    ```
4.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python age_distribution_chart.py
    ```
    This will generate `age_distribution_chart.png` in the same directory.

## Visualization Output

The `age_distribution_chart.png` file will display a bar chart with age groups on the x-axis and population counts on the y-axis, providing a clear visual representation of the population's age distribution.
